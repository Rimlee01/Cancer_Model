# **Detect Cancer Early**
### Project Overview

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict whether a given input  or benign based on features extracted from medical data. The model uses various classification algorithms to make accurate predictions, which can help medical professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making processes.

The goal of this project was to implement and evaluate different machine learning models and to understand their strengths and limitations in the context of cancer detection.
## **Technologies Used**

**Programing language:** Python,Html,Css,JavaScript

**Libraries/Frameworks:**
    
*   Flask: lightweight, flexible Python framework for building web applications and APIs with minimal overhead.

*   scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.

*   pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

*   matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

*   numpy: For numerical operations.

*   numpy: For numerical operations.

*   joblib & pickle : Python libraries used for serializing and deserializing objects to/from files.

**Dataset:**

*   Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
*   Lung Cancer dataset
*   Colorectal Cancer dataset
*   Prostate Cancer dataset

## **Problem Statement**
Early detection of cancer is crucial for better treatment outcomes. Using a set of diagnostic features from the datasets, the goal is to predict whether a tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
## **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, normalized the dataset, and performed feature scaling to prepare the data for training.
- **Model Selection:** Implemented multiple classification algorithms such as:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Random Forest
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for model evaluation.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied GridSearchCV,RandomSearchCV for optimal hyperparameter selection.


##  **How to Run the Project**

1.Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer_model.git
cd cancer_model

```
2.Install dependencies (using pip or conda):

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3.Run the Jupyter notebook (or Python script):

```bash
    jupyter notebook app_notebook.ipynb
```
Or if running the Python script directly:

```bash
    python app.py
```
- Best Model: Random Forest showed the best performance across multiple metrics.



## **Features & Improvements**
